# Simple Banking Application (Java CLI with Synchronization)

## Project Description
A simple command-line banking application written in Java that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their account balance. It demonstrates thread-safe operations on a shared bank account balance using synchronized blocks to avoid race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.

## Features
- Deposit money with input validation
- Withdraw money with sufficient balance checks
- Check current account balance
- Thread-safe operations using synchronized blocks
- Simple CLI menu interface for user interaction

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files:
2. Run the application:
3. Use the menu to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit.

## Future Improvements
- Support multiple user accounts with login
- Add transaction history and receipts
- Implement multi-threaded simulation of concurrent transactions
- Add password protection and secure authentication
